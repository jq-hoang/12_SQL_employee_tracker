# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## My Task: 

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. As a result, I've built a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database.

## Technologies Used:
- Node.js
- Inquirer
- MySQL2

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Preview: 

The following video shows an example of the application being used from the command line:
